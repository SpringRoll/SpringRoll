# SpringRoll


SpringRoll is a light-weight toolset for building accessible HTML5 games. The latest version, SpringRoll 2, is a large departure from its predecessor. SpringRoll 2 is less prescriptive and contains only a few guidelines and restrictions. Instead, the framework focuses on utilities to help developers make games more accessible and deployable at scale.

## Quick Navigation
If you need more info on the various components of SpringRoll see the individual docs below or view the [module overview](#module-overview)

- [Application](./src/README.md) - The main SpringRoll Application class 
- [Plugin architecture](./src/plugins) - implementing and/or using custom plugins to augment SpringRoll behaviour
- Accessibility Module - SpringRoll contains submodules for various accessibility testing and enhancement. 
  - [Color Filter module](./src/accessibility/ColorFilter) - provides filters for testing color blindness support in your game.
  - [Speech Synth module](./accessibility/SpeechSynth/README.md) - gives developers the ability to synthesize speech from text.
- [Controller module](./src/controller) - provides a mechanism for mapping keyboard input to functions
- [Debugger module](./src/debug) - provides a centralized set of methods for logging that can be enabled or disabled at runtime.
- Localization Modules
  - [Localizer](./src/localization/localizer) - provides support for multiple language
  - [Captions](./src/localization/captions) - Caption players and renderers 
- [Scale Manager](./src/scale-manager) - helps developers to react to screen size changes.
- [State Manager](./src/state) - provides classes for creating subscribable properties that notify listeners when they are changed

## Design Considerations

The SpringRoll ecosystem provides a combination of mechanisms for deploying games via the web:

* DEPRECATED: [~~SpringRollConnect~~](https://github.com/SpringRoll/SpringRollConnect), a release management system for games.
* The [SpringRollContainer](https://github.com/SpringRoll/SpringRollContainer), an iframe based controller for loading and controlling SpringRoll games in an HTML environment.
* [Bellhop](https://github.com/SpringRoll/Bellhop), an event layer that enriches the [postMessage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) for improved communication between the container and game.

SpringRoll games, also referred to as Applications, are typically hosted in an iframe and controlled via a SpringRoll Container instance. This extra layer is mainly used to separate the game's internals from the environment in which it lives. This allows the game to live in multiple environments without any complicated environment specific code. The application can request relevant information from the container without having to know where that information came from.

## [Seed Project](https://github.com/SpringRoll/Springroll-Seed)
We provide a very basic starter project that comes with Webpack for quick project ramp up.

We've also provided a few template projects.
* [PIXI](https://github.com/SpringRoll/Springroll-Seed/tree/templates/pixi)
* [Phaser 3](https://github.com/SpringRoll/Springroll-Seed/tree/templates/phaser3)
* [CreateJS](https://github.com/SpringRoll/Springroll-Seed/tree/templates/createjs)


## Installation
SpringRoll is both ES6 module and UMD compatible, and is [available via NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/springroll). NPM can install it directly from the command line:

```
npm install --save springroll@2
```

However, to request a specific commit or branch, update package.json directly:

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies" : {
    "springroll": "git+https://github.com/SpringRoll/SpringRoll.git#v2"
  }
  ...
}
```

Once the module is installed, SpringRoll can be imported in ES6 directly:

```javascript
import * as springroll from 'springroll';

const app = new springroll.Application();
```

or with CommonJS:

```javascript
const springroll = require('springroll');

const app = new springroll.Application();
```

or even as a browser global:

```html
<script src="node_modules/springroll/dist/SpringRoll.js"></script>
<script>
const app = new window.springroll.Application();
</script>
```

## Module Overview
SpringRoll consists of a handful of modules intended to help developers improve the accessibility of their game.

### Application Module
The `Application` class provides the main communication bus through which the game can send and receive messages to the container. It also manages global game state, such as pause and captions display. More information can be found in the [Application module documentation](./src/README.md). It also consists of a simple [plugin architecture](./src/plugins) for hooking into the load sequence of applications.

### Accessibility Module
SpringRoll contains submodules for various accessibility testing and enhancement. The [Color Filter module](./src/accessibility/ColorFilter) provides filters for testing color blindness support in your game. Enabling the class allows developers to see what their game would look like for various types of color vision deficiency. The [Speech Synth module](./accessibility/SpeechSynth/README.md) gives developers the ability to synthesize speech from text.

### Controller Module
The [Controller module](./src/controller) provides a mechanism for mapping keyboard input to functions which can help centralize user input management and make supporting multiple input mechanisms easier.

### Debugger Module
The [Debugger module](./src/debug) provides a centralized set of methods for logging that can be enabled or disabled at runtime.

### Localization Module
The Localization module provides support for supporting [multiple languages in games](./src/localization/localizer) and [captions](./src/localization/captions)

### Scale Manager Module
The [Scale Manager module](./src/scale-manager) helps developers to react to screen size changes.

### State Manager Module
The [State Manager module](./src/state) provides classes for creating subscribable properties that notify listeners when they are changed. This is used for managing pause, captions, and audio mute state in the [Application class](./src/), but can also be used for other generic uses.

## Differences between v1 and v2 branches

### V1 (Legacy)
V1 is the original version of SpringRoll and was built to address many issues/missing functionality that are now native to JavaScript since ES2016. It comes with its own versions of popular libraries like Pixi.js and Easel.js, but it's not recommended to use this version as it will only receive legacy support.

### V2 (Recommended)
V2 is massive overhaul of SpringRoll, removing all third party libraries and is rewritten to utilize ES2016. This version will be actively receiving bug fixes, new features and is the recommended version of SpringRoll.

## BrowserStack Testing
To test Springroll v2 on BrowserStack. Copy `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env`. Replace the placeholder values with your own BrowserStack credentials, and then run `npm run test:bs`.
